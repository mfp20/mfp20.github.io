mfp20 is [mfp19](https://mfp19.github.io/). But mfp19 is not mfp20. (Non-)Biunivocity is a property of some math things that
I don't reccomend for you to study if you're not mad enough to truly be willing of; it could be highly syntetized as 
"a function contained into another function".
But don't tell this to a mathematician ... you could be dragged into the muddish math epistemology for the next 20 days. And hope there's no
metamatician in the proximity or ... the days will be 40 plus overhead: 20 for math, 20 for philosophy, and the overhead to disambiguate.
To make it simpler for you: I just red mfp19 before writing mfp20. More info about identity problems, identity management, identity issues
and alike, have a look at the [contacts](contact/) and [keys](keys/) page.

All the rest is the same:

> I'm making this spot to study some technological details, and for fun. 
> There's not much I've to say. Please, don't take it serious.

Value added: it cuts down who's tracking my mfp19 crap. For a few weeks, as usual.

By the way, going from the 19th century to the 20th I've just reincarnated into another animal, the faster, the more furious ... a cool one. 
This is my new livery.
