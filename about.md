Going from the [19th century](https://mfp19.github.io/) to the 20th I've just reincarnated into another animal, the faster, the more furious ... a cool one. 
This is me in my new livery when I try to look smart.

mfp20 is [mfp19](https://mfp19.github.io/about/). But mfp19 is not mfp20. (Non-)Biunivocity is a property of some math things that
I don't reccomend for you to study if you're not mad enough to truly be willing of; it could be highly synthetised as 
"a function contained into another function". But don't tell this def to a mathematician: you could be dragged into the muddish math epistemology for the next 20 days. And hope there's no
metamatematician in the proximity or ... the days will be 40 plus overhead: 20 for math, 20 for philosophy, and the overhead to disambiguate. 

By the way: summary and synthesis, in this context, are the same thing.

To make it simpler for you: I just red mfp19 before writing mfp20, but I planned to write mfp20 before writing mfp19. It looks the things look smarter, 
but I assure you: they aren't. Just more sexy.
For more info about identity problems, identity management, identity issues and alike, have a look at the [contacts](/contact/) and [keys](/keys/) page.

Ah, I also inverted the bg-fg colors. Just to remember which mfp I'm currently writing.

All the rest is the same:

> I'm making this spot to study some technological details, and for fun. 
> There's not much I've to say. Please, don't take it serious.

Value added: it interrupts, for a little while, the ones tracking mfp19. For a few weeks, as usual. Then I'll get another bunch of asshoolics bothering.

Here me in my everyday cage, pretty bored.

This is me at work.

Ok, now consult a behaevioural scientist to know Anything You Want about me; and please, annotate everything on a Facebook Profile with my name on top.
