Phone, Email, Skype, etc.
=========================

Don't fucking bother me! If you want to talk (serious), get a plane/train/drone/bicycle/three-cubic-wheeled-crap, buy 2 beers, 
and come to say "Hallo Asshole!" (it is the pass word; be sure to spell it properly; and wait for my side one).

If the local store don't have beers, any low alchoolic stuff is ok; weed would be better but here where I am is ... not legal (yet) 
and I can't pay you a lawyer, so... you choose. Heavy spirits instead, are for deep shit topics only (cancer, death, divorce, jail, etc), 
and for warming up a night out (ie: not for talking serious). Sorry but since epathitis, my liver can't bare those.

If you want to talk more than 30 minutes, buy coffee instead of beer because near the end of the first beer I start looking
at any round shape around resembling female boobs/eyes/ass, and focus on whatever is not serious.

For more details (confidentiality, integrity, ecc) refer to [mfp19's contacts page](https://mfp19.github.io/contact/): he did a so good job over there that... 
I could have written that stuff myself.

Updates.

WORK IN PROGRESS ...
