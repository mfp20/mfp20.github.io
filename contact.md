Phone, Email, Skype, etc.
=========================

Don't fucking bother me! If you want to talk (serious), get a plane/train/drone/bicycle/three-cubic-wheeled-crap, buy 2 beers, 
and come to say "Hallo Asshole!" (it is the pass word; be sure to spell it properly; and wait for my side one). If you want to talk more than 30 minutes, 
buy coffee instead of beer because near the end of the first beer I start looking at any round shape around resembling female boobs/eyes/ass, 
and focus on whatever else is not serious.

For more details (confidentiality, integrity, ecc) refer to [mfp19's contacts page](https://mfp19.github.io/contact/): he did a so good job over there that... 
I could have written that stuff myself.

Update.
========

I just moved my ass into another continent, again. The VISA system, and fraudsters in my embassy, was killing me. I left a few accounts behind, more clones
are coming ...
