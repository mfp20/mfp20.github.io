Short version: until a cop/judge/whatever is entitled to steal our devices, encrypting is just a style excercise to keep our brains fit and tidy; 
and because my data - all of it, since I was 15yo - has been stolen by cops in 2007, and again in 2010, and abused ... 
my whole identity is in the public domain since then, and they don't want to pay for the damages.

A more stylish way to say the same thing, from Rooty's blog "[State considered harmful](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/10/27/x86_harmful.html)".
