title: Ethereum is Doomed, long live Ethereum.
author: mfp20

This guy [here](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/ethereum-is-doomed/) is saying that Ethereum is flawed by design.
Note: "Satoshi Nakamoto Institute" let anyone think at Bitcoin creators... go figure if it is real; I've no idea who Daniel Krawisz is; and, as mfp19 said,
I didn't put my hands on Ethereum, nor Bitcoin (a part for digging in one of those bitcoin libs searching for SHA details, only; the code seemed to be good).
But the whole thing looks like Forbes howling that Bitcoin was dead, half-dozen times in the past 6 years, and it is still running instead 
(at least, the client connects). Bitcoin had legacy finance only trying to destroy public trust in that tool; Ethereum has legacy finance and Bitcoin holders. 
Please, forgive my skepticism about the death of Ethereum (too). I'm more passionate about questions like 
"What does it happen after ALL the SHA256 hashes has been digged out? Can transactions still occur?".

Let me recap: a guy found that repeating the same op he could move Ether (credits) without using gas (ie: pay for the electricity) AND without executing 
any further function, selling anything, and so on. Just Ether farming. He did that a few millions times until he got a few million ethers.
When the Ethereum Foundation figured out that a guy had found a way to suck 1/20th of its total reserves ... invited the peers to update their software
with a patched one that would freeze the transaction. The transaction completion is due in 2 weeks unless the network owners decide as a whole to branch out
the guy. That's cool!

When I first saw Ethereum website, there was a cartoonish american desert panorama explicitly warning that the new frontier was dangerous. It was a beta, 
they warned. I didn't join but I promised myself to do it as soon as I could spend (bet?) enough money. Now the website is different; more business oriented;
probably because they ended their beta stage between november 2015 and january 2016. 
I've no idea when the genious guy ("The Attacker") joined the Ethereum community but ... it could be 100% legit, to consider that exploit a bug, 
and freeze the transaction. 
Even without asking for a referendum in the Ethereum community. Honestly I would do it: check the account creation date and crack him out in the case he
bet despite the huge warning on my webpage. In the case I'm not in the position to do it (ie: the system is distributed enough to not allow those imperative
actions) I would just move any asset out of that foundation and create a new one, documenting the whole thing. Better to pay a big lawyer firm to escrow the
whole process than to allow a whiner to kill my baby in it's first months of life: "it's a beta, you've been warned, idiot!".

Second, a way far solution could be an old Ancient Rome law about people returning valuables found in the streets. If you turn it back, you get 10% of its value from 
the legittimate owner. After all, it wouldn't be the first time an hacker get paid for finding a bug. Actually, there have been plenty companies having
for their core business ... to find bugs and vulnerabilities. He did it, he deserve it. And I would do this too: "I cracked you out and left 10% for you; 
thanks for discovering that bug. Please let's meet so that I can personally deliver your win to the one that burned the hairs on my ass, and see if we can
work togheter in the near futureò If now yours are burning instead, please just tell your lawyer to send us your bank account coordinates to transfer your win.
If you want to go for an All-In... well... sue me, asshole". That's all.

About the long-term problem highlighted by Daniel Krawisz (linked above) ... I should read the code first but I prefer to give for good what Daniel wrote and 
blindly comment his summary:

> They created a situation in which bugs would be expected to arise in an environment in which bugs are legally exploitable. That is hacker heaven.

Is he talking about the univers and the human perverse tendancy to not consider it an open system? Dear Daniel ... ehm ... did you notice that they are based in Switzerland 
and "The Attacker" is talking about "fully compliant with United States criminal and tort law"? 
How can you say then that ... the bugs are legally exploitable? And things get even more complicate every time a "foundation" is involved because ... in theory ... it is a nonprofit entity. 
Lawyers too could be mistaken or openly fraud. If they exist. Last but not the least, I would say that set up a lawsuit against them it might be like shooting the Red Cross.

To be clear: Ethereum might be seriusly flawed; I can't say the opposite but ... alea jacta est. They have shown us all a direction.
I've been playing before calling bug&feature the same item. Now I've learned that I can do the same saying "torto" (en. tort) and "torta" (en. cake), 
in italian. Sweet, thank you.
